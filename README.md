## 📖 About the project
When you are moving to a new city to start university it is super difficult to find good accomodation. As an example, throughout my 5 years as a student at Lund University I lived in 5 different places. Some were good, some were bad and some were a scam. To help solve this problem for new students, I hacked together an MVP and launched www.dormrun.com in a weekend.
