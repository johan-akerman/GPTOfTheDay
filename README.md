## 📖 About the project
In November 2023 Open AI announced the release of custom GPTs. Thousands of GPTs were created overnight but there were no place to find them. Within hours, directories started appearing online where you could upload your custom GPTs before Open AI released their official AppStore. However, all these directories lacked the ability to filter out, rank and separate the great amongst the good. Therefore, we (Amin and Johan) spent the next days hacking together ProductHunt for custom GPTs - a place where you could submit, vote and comment on GPTs to encourage people to build and launch great stuff. 

The project may not have become as successful as we wished in regard to # of users, but we achieved our original goal of building something together and going from an idea to launch within just a couple of days 🚀
